Description

A robust deep-learning approach that consists of long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural networks as base learners in a stacking ensemble framework, with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) as the meta-learner. Meanwhile, the hybrid synthetic minority oversampling technique and edited nearest neighbor (SMOTE-ENN) method is employed to balance the class distribution in the dataset. The experimental results showed that combining the proposed deep learning ensemble with the SMOTE-ENN method achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 1.000 and 0.997, respectively, which is superior to other widely used ML classifiers and methods in the literature.
